     " A serious disease of apples and ornamental crabapples, apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) attacks both leaves and fruit. The fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves. Dark, velvety spots may appear on the lower surface. Severely infected leaves become twisted and puckered and may drop early in the summer. Symptoms on fruit are similar to those found on leaves. Scabby spots are sunken and tan and may have velvety spores in the center. As these spots mature, they become larger and turn brown and corky. Infected fruit becomes distorted and may crack allowing entry of secondary organisms. Severely affected fruit may drop, especially when young. Apple scab overwinters primarily in fallen leaves and in the soil. Disease development is favored by wet, cool weather that generally occurs in spring and early summer. Fungal spores are carried by wind, rain or splashing water from the ground to flowers, leaves or fruit. During damp or rainy periods, newly opening apple leaves are extremely susceptible to infection. The longer the leaves remain wet, the more severe the infection will be. Apple scab spreads rapidly between 55-75 degrees F. Rake under trees and destroy infected leaves to reduce the number of fungal spores available to start the disease cycle over again next spring.Water in the evening or early morning hours (avoid overhead irrigation) to give the leaves time to dry out before infection can occur.Spread a 3- to 6-inch layer of compost under trees, keeping it away from the trunk, to cover soil and prevent splash dispersal of the fungal spores. For best control, spray liquid copper soap early, two weeks before symptoms normally appear. Alternatively, begin applications when disease first appears, and repeat at 7 to 10 day intervals up to blossom drop. Bonide --Sulfur Plant Fungicide, a finely ground wettable powder, is used in pre-blossom applications and must go on before rainy or spore discharge periods. Apply from pre-pink through cover (2 Tbsp/ gallon of water), or use in cover sprays up to the day of harvest Organocide-- Plant Doctor is an earth-friendly systemic fungicide that works its way through the entire plant to combat a large number of diseases on ornamentals, turf, fruit and more. Apply as a soil drench or foliar spray (3-4 tsp/ gallon of water) to prevent and attack fungal problems.   ",

    "Black rot is a disease of apples that infects fruit, leaves, and bark caused by the fungus Botryosphaeria obtusa. It can also jump to healthy tissue on pear or quince trees but is typically a secondary fungus of weak or dead tissues in other plants. Begin checking your apple trees for signs of infection about a week after the petals fall from your apple blossoms. Early symptoms are often limited to leaf symptoms such as purple spots on upper leaf surfaces. As these spots age, the margins remain purple, but the centers dry out and turn yellow to brown. Over time, the spots expand and heavily infected leaves drop from the tree. Infected branches or limbs will show characteristic red-brown sunken areas that expand each year. Fruit infection is the most destructive form of this pathogen and begins with infected flowers before fruits expand. When fruits are tiny and green, you’ll notice red flecks or purplish pimples that enlarge as the fruit does. Mature fruit lesions take on a bulls-eye appearance, with bands of brown and black areas expanding outward from a central point in each lesion. Commonly, black rot disease causes blossom end rot or mummification of the fruits on the tree. Treating black rot on apple trees starts with sanitation. Because fungal spores overwinter on fallen leaves, mummified fruits, dead bark, and cankers, it’s important to keep all the fallen debris and dead fruit cleaned up and away from the tree. During the winter, check for red cankers and remove them by cutting them out or pruning away the affected limbs at least six inches (15 cm.) beyond the wound. Destroy all infected tissue immediately and keep a watchful eye out for new signs of infection. Once black rot disease is under control in your tree and you’re again harvesting healthy fruits, make sure to remove any injured or insect-invaded fruits to avoid re-infection. Although general-purpose fungicides, like copper-based sprays and lime sulfur, can be used to control black rot, nothing will improve apple black rot like removing all sources of spores. ",

    "Cedar apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae) is a fungal disease that requires juniper plants to complete its complicated two year life-cycle. Spores overwinter as a reddish-brown gall on young twigs of various juniper species. In early spring, during wet weather, these galls swell and bright orange masses of spores are blown by the wind where they infect susceptible apple and crab-apple trees. The spores that develop on these trees will only infect junipers the following year. From year to year, the disease must pass from junipers to apples to junipers again; it cannot spread between apple trees. On apple and crab-apple trees, look for pale yellow pinhead sized spots on the upper surface of the leaves shortly after bloom. These gradually enlarge to bright orange-yellow spots which make the disease easy to identify. Orange spots may develop on the fruit as well. Heavily infected leaves may drop prematurely. Choose resistant cultivars when available.Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and other debris from under trees.Remove galls from infected junipers. In some cases, juniper plants should be removed entirely.Apply preventative, disease-fighting fungicides labeled for use on apples weekly, starting with bud break, to protect trees from spores being released by the juniper host. This occurs only once per year, so additional applications after this springtime spread are not necessary. Safely treat most fungal and bacterial diseases with SERENADE Garden. This broad spectrum bio-fungicide uses a patented strain of Bacillus subtilis that is registered for organic use. Best of all, SERENADE is completely non-toxic to honey bees and beneficial insects. Containing sulfur and pyrethrins, Bonide® Orchard Spray is a safe, one-hit concentrate for insect attacks and fungal problems. For best results, apply as a protective spray (2.5 oz/ gallon) early in the season. If disease, insects or wet weather are present, mix 5 oz in one gallon of water. Thoroughly spray all parts of the plant, especially new shoots.  ",

    " Apple, Malus domestica, is a deciduous tree in the family Rosaceae which is grown for its fruits, known as apples. Apple fruits are one of the most widely cultivated fruits in the world, are round (pome) in shape and range in color from green to red. When planted from a seed, an apple tree can take six to ten years to mature and produce fruit of its own. Apple trees are small to medium sized trees reaching heights of 5–10 m (16.4–32.8 ft), with a central trunk which divides into several branches. The leaves of the tree are oval in shape and can reach up to 13 cm (5.1 in) in length and 7 cm (2.8 in) in width. Apple may also be referred to as mela or appel and the domestic tree is believed to have originated from Western Asia and the Mediterranean from several wild ancestors. Apples are most commonly eaten fresh but can also be used for baking and cooking. Apples can also be processed into apple sauce, cider, vinegar, juice or butter while slices can be dried for later consumption. Apples can also be used for the extraction of useful compounds such as fructose and pectin. Apple trees grow best in the tropics and at higher latitudes they require a mild growing season and a cold winter to break their dormancy. At these latitudes, the tree will flower in spring and fruit will ripen in the fall. In the tropics, the leaves will remain on the tree longer so that it is essentially evergreen and flowering and fruiting will happen sporadically throughout the year unless the tree is managed to enforce a uniform cycle across the entire tree by bending shoots to create a wide tree. The standard method of propagating apple is by budding. When planting an apple nursery or orchard it is highly advisable to plant seedlings budded from root stock to prevent an increase in dormancy of the buds. Budded trees should be pruned in the first year to encourage new shoot growth. In the tropics, apple trees require careful management in order to make the heavy crop loads sustainable. This includes bending shoots, pruning the tips and also defoliating the trees. Flowers are also removed to promote growth until the first fruit production, generally after 2 years. Apple trees can also be propagated by grafting and mound layering. Grafting involves joining the lower part of one plant (root stock) with the upper part (scion) of another. Grafting is usually done during the dormant season and must be done on dormant scion and stock wood. Mound layering is used to propagate apple clonal root stocks. Soil is mounded around shoots that have been cut back, thereby stimulating roots to grow at the base of the shoots. A year before propagation begins, 8–10 mm (0.3–0.4 in) diameter stock plants are planted in rows and then cut back to 45–60 cm (17.7–23.6 in). They are then grown for one year. In the spring, the plants are again cut back, this time to 2.5 cm (1 in) above the ground. New shoots gradually form and more soil and bark are added in mounds around the plants. This cycle can continue on through the growing season. Then the shoots are harvested by cutting close to the bases. The mother stool beds are then left exposed until further growth of the new shoots has occurred, and another cycle of hilling begins.    ",

    "  Blueberry is a crown forming, woody, perennial shrub in the family Ericaceae grown for its fruits, or berries, of the same name. The blueberry plant possesses oval or elliptical leaves which grow alternately on the stems. The stems, or twigs, are yellow/green in color and turn reddish in winter. Flowers are bell shaped and can be either white or pink, occurring in clusters of 8 to 10 flowers. Berries are blue to black in color and 0.6–1.3 cm (0.25–0.5 in) in size. Lowbush blueberry plants (including Vaccinium angustifolium) are smaller in stature, reaching heights of 35 to 60 cm (13.8–23.6 in) and with proper management can produce fruit for between 40 and 50 years. Lowbush blueberries are also sometimes referred to as Maine, New Hampshire or wild blueberry and are native to eastern/central Canada and northeastern United States. Highbush blueberries (including Vaccinium corymbosum) are generally 2–3 m (6.6–9.8 ft) in height but can reach up to 5 m (16.4 ft) and may also be referred to as huckleberry or swamp blueberry. Highbush blueberry accounts for most of the commercial production of blueberry fruit and is also native only to North America. Blueberries can be eaten fresh or can be dried or baked for further processing. Frozen or pureed berries are commonly used to make jams and preserves and baked goods. Lowbush blueberry is commonly used to make wine. Lowbush blueberry grows best in well-drained, acidic soils with a pH between 4.5 and 4.8 and should be planted in early Spring as purchased plants or as “plugs” (a small cutting, including root, from an established bush). The newly planted blueberry should be covered in a couple of inches of mulch to conserve moisture in the soil. Any flowers produced by the plants should be removed for at least one year after planting to promote vigor and new growth. Plants should be pruned by cutting close to the ground and a pruned plant will not produce any fruit in the first year, but in the second year subsequent to pruning their should be a good yield. Growth can be stimulated by field-burning, as these plants are very fire-tolerant. Highbush blueberry can be propagated from seeds, cuttings from an established plant or bare root and should be planted in late Fall. Blueberry plants grow best in well drained, highly acidic soils with a pH between 4.5 and 5.8. The plants have a shallow root system and should be planted in a hole at least twice as large as the existing root system and mulched with a 7-10 cm (3-4 in) layer of organic mulch. The first year of blossom should be removed to encourage new growth and it is also recommended to do the same in the second year. Plants should be pruned annually, particularly after the first two years, to promote plant vigour and remove diseased or broken canes. Irrigation is recommended due to the shallow root system and greatly promotes the fruit yield this practice is highly recommended if growing commercially.",

    " Common on many plants and easily recognized, powdery mildew is a fungal disease found throughout the United States. It is caused by a variety of closely related fungal species, each with a limited host range. (The fungi attacking your roses are unlikely to spread to your lilacs). Low soil moisture combined with high humidity levels at the plant surface favors this disease. Symptoms usually appear later in the growing season on outdoor plants. Powdery mildew starts on young leaves as raised blister-like areas that cause leaves to curl, exposing the lower leaf surface. Infected leaves become covered with a white to gray powdery growth, usually on the upper surface; unopened flower buds may be white with mildew and may never open. Leaves of severely infected plants turn brown and drop. The disease prefers young, succulent growth; mature leaves are usually not affected. Fungal spores overwinter inside leaf buds and other plant debris. Wind, water and insects transmit the spores to other nearby plants. Zucchini, beans, cucumbers, squash, pumpkins, tomatoes, roses and zinnia are especially susceptible. Plant resistant cultivars in sunny locations whenever possible.Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.Remove diseased foliage from the plant and clean up fallen debris on the ground.Use a thick layer of mulch or organic compost to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will prevent the disease spores from splashing back up onto the leaves. Milk sprays, made with 40% milk and 60% water, are an effective home remedy for use on a wide range of plants. For best results, spray plant leaves as a preventative measure every 10-14 days.Wash foliage occasionally to disrupt the daily spore-releasing cycle. Neem oil and PM Wash, used on a 7 day schedule, will prevent fungal attack on plants grown indoors. Water in the morning, so plants have a chance to dry during the day. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses will help keep the foliage dry.Use a slow-release, organic fertilizer on crops and avoid excess nitrogen. Soft, leafy, new growth is most susceptible. Destroy all plant debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup)."

    "The wild cherry tree, Prunus avium, is a perennial tree in the family Rosaceae grown for its fruit, the cherry. Cherry trees have alternating simple oval leaves which often have serrated margins and approximately eight pairs of veins, 5–13 cm (2–5 in) long. The flowers are white and appear in clusters of about 3–5. They appear in early spring and are about one inch long. The fruit is dark red, about half an inch to a full inch, matures in early to mid summer. The bark is gray-brown, smooth and glossy and it often peels. Cherry trees can live up to 60 years, growing to a height of over 15 m (50 ft). Cherry may also be referred to as sweet cherry, gean, mazzard or wild cherry and originates from the Caspian-Black Sea region and Asia. Sour cherry, Prunus cerasus, is closely related to Prunus avium but with fruit that is more acidic. The tree has twiggy branches with bright red to near black cherries. The tree reaches a height of 4–10 m (13.1–16.4 ft) and is believed to have originated as a natural hybrid of wild cherry (Prunus avium) and ground cherry (Prunus fruticosa) somewhere in the Caucasus Mountains, Turkey or Eastern Europe where the two species' geographic ranges overlap.. Cherries are mainly consumed as a fresh fruit or processed into jellies and juices. The wood of the cherry tree is a distinctive honey color and is used in furniture making and for musical instruments. Sour cherries are used mainly for canning and processing. Basic requirements Cherries grow optimally in mild, dry climates and also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy so require cold winters. Because of the cold weather requirement, none of the Prunus family, including cherries, can grow in tropical climates. Cherry trees will grow in a variety of soils provided that they are well-draining. Soils which remain wet for prolonged periods of time and soils that become excessively dry should be avoided. Trees will perform best if planted in sandy soil with a pH of 5.5–7.5. Planting on a gentle slope is beneficial for cherry as cold air can drain away from the trees to lower areas, helping to prevent damage. Sweet cherries bloom earlier than sour cherries and can be susceptible to damage from late frosts. Propagation Cherry nurseries are mainly propagated by budding and grafting onto 1–2 year old seedling grown from seed. In order to grow from seed, pits should be planted in the fall (after first being chilled) and seedlings will emerge in the spring. A cherry tree will take three-four years to produce its first crop of fruit and seven years to attain full maturity. Planting Cherry trees should be planted in the Spring when all danger of frost has passed and the soil has warmed. If bare root plants have been purchased, be sure to keep the root ball moist prior to planting. The tree should be planted in a hole which is large enough to accommodate the root ball without bending any of the roots. Broken or damaged roots can be removed but try to avoid pruning the roots. Place the tree in the planting hole and carefully backfill with soil. The tree should be planted at the same depth as it was in the nursery. Carefully firm or tamp the soil to prevent air pockets and when the planting hole is about 2/3 filled, water the roots thoroughly before filling the remainder of the hole with top soil. The tree should be watered as needed throughout the first year of growth. Training and pruning Cherry trees are usually trained to a modified central leader system where the lateral limbs branch from a central trunk. Sweet cherries have a more upright growth habit than sour cherries which tend to have a more open and spreading canopy. Trees should only pruned lightly while the tree matures and reaches maximum productivity. Any dead or damaged branches should be removed. General care and maintenance The area around the base of the tree should be kept free from weeds either by cultivating or using a chemical weed control. In the home garden, trees are usually surrounded by turf with only a small area of soil around the trunk which is easy to keep weed free by hand. Unless grown in fertile soils, cherry trees may require the addition of some nitrogen fertilizer, the volume of which will vary with the age of the tree. The fertilizer should be applied in a band around the trunk of the tree.",

    "Gray leaf spot (GLS) is a common fungal disease in the United States caused by the pathogen Cercospora zeae-maydis in corn.Disease development is favored by warm temperatures, 80°F or 27 °C; and high humidity, relative humidity of 90% or higher for 12 hours or more. Cercospora zeae-maydis overwinters in corn residue, allowing inoculum to build up from year to year in fields.Cropping systems with reduced- or no-till and/or continuous corn are at higher risk for gray leaf spot outbreaks.Conducive weather conditions encourage the rapid spread of disease near the end of summer and early fall, when corn plants allocate more resources to grainfill. Gray leaf spot lesions begin as small necrotic pinpoints with chlorotic halos, these are more visible when leaves are backlit.Coloration of initial lesions can range from tan to brown before sporulation begins.Because early lesions are ambiguous, they are easily confused with other foliar diseases such as anthracnose leaf blight, eyespot, or common rust. Cercospora zeae-maydis overwinters in corn debris, so production practices such as tillage and crop rotation that reduce the amount corn residue on the surface will decrease the amount of primary inoculum.Crop rotation away from corn can reduce disease pressure, but multiple years may be necessary in no-till scenarios Planting hybrids with a high level of genetic resistance can help reduce the risk of yield loss due to gray leaf spot infection.Pioneer® brand hybrids and parent lines are improved through a screening process in areas with a high incidence of GLS and specialized “disease nurseries”.Customers can see the effectiveness of hybrid resistance based off of a score (ranging from 1 to 9) that is assigned to Pioneer brand products.Susceptible hybrids are more likely to benefit from a foliar fungicide application, but resistant varieties may benefit as well under high gray leaf spot pressure During the growing season, foliar fungicides can be used to manage gray leaf spot outbreaks.Farmers must consider the cost of the application and market value of their corn before determining if fungicides will be an economical solution to GLS.

    "Northern leaf blight in corn is a bigger problem for large farms than for home gardeners, but if you grow corn in your Midwestern garden, you may see this fungal infection. The fungus that causes the disease overwinters in debris and proliferates during moderate temperatures and wet conditions. You can manage and prevent the fungal infection or use a fungicide. Northern corn leaf blight is an infection caused by a fungus that is fairly common in the Midwest, wherever corn is grown. The disease generally only causes limited damage, but it may lead to crop loss under certain conditions. Some varieties of corn are more susceptible, and when the infection sets in early, losses are often greater. The characteristic sign of corn with northern leaf blight is the formation of lesions on the leaves. They are long, narrow lesions that eventually turn brown. The lesions may also form greyish colored borders around their edges. The lesions begin to form on lower leaves and spread to higher leaves as the disease progresses. During humid weather, the lesions may develop spores that make them look dirty or dusty. Control of this disease is often focused on management and prevention. First, choose corn varieties or hybrids that are resistant or at least have moderate resistance to northern corn leaf blight. When you grow corn, make sure it does not stay wet for long periods of time. The fungus that causes this infection needs between six and 18 hours of leaf wetness to develop. Plant corn with enough space for airflow and water in the morning so leaves can dry throughout the day. The fungus overwinters in plant material, so it is also important to manage infected plants. Tilling the corn into the soil is one strategy, but with a small garden it may make more sense to just remove and destroy the affected plants. Treating northern corn leaf blight involves using fungicides. For most home gardeners this step isn’t needed, but if you have a bad infection, you may want to try this chemical treatment. The infection usually begins around the time of silking, and this is when the fungicide should be applied.  ",

    "Maize, Zea mays, is an annual grass in the family Poaceae and is a staple food crop grown all over the world. The maize plant possesses a simple stem of nodes and internodes. A pair of large leaves extend off of each internode and the leaves total 8–21 per plant. The leaves are linear or lanceolate (lance-like) with an obvious midrib (primary vein) and can grow from 30 to 100 cm (11.8–39.4 in) in length. The male and female inflorescences (flower bearing region of the plant) are positioned separately on the plant. The male inflorescence is known as the 'tassel' while the female inflorescence is the 'ear'. The ear of the maize is a modified spike and there may be 1–3 per plant. The maize grains, or 'kernels', are encased in husks and total 30–1000 per ear. The kernels can be white, yellow, red, purple or black. Maize is an annual plant, surviving for only one growing season and can reach 2–3 m (7–10 ft) in height. Maize may also be referred to as corn or Indian corn and is believed to originate from Mexico and Central America. Maize and cornmeal (dried, ground maize) are staple foods in countries all over the world. The ears can be cooked and eaten from the cob as a vegetable or the kernels can be removed and either eaten as is or used to produce a wide variety of foodstuffs including cereals and flour. Maize is also a major source of starch, which can be processed into oils and high fructose corn syrup. Maize is also commonly grown as feed for livestock. Basic requirements Maize is best grown in warm, tropical and sub-tropical regions as it requires warm soils to develop optimally. One of the most important requirements for growing maize is a high quality soil which is deep, fertile and well-draining with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Maize plants are very heavy feeders and even the most fertile of soils may need to supplemented with nutrients as the plants develop, particularly nitrogen. Maize also requires plenty of space as it grows and is pollinated by wind. It should be planted where it will receive full sunlight for most of the day and provided with ample moisture. Planting Planting dates for maize depend on the variety being grown. Standard varieties should be planted when the soil has warmed to at least 12.7°C (55°F) and supersweet varieties when the soil reaches 18.3°C (65°F). Soil can be brought up to temperature faster by laying black plastic mulches approximately 1 week prior to planting. Seeds should be sown about 2.5 cm (1 in) deep and 10–15 cm (~3–4 in) apart allowing 76–91 cm (~30–36 in) between rows. Maize should be planted in blocks (numerous rows) rather than in a single long row as it is wind pollinated and pollen can transfer between plants much more efficiently. Seedlings should be thinned to a final spacing 20–30 cm (8–12 in) when they are approximately 7.5–10.0 cm (3–4 in) in height. It is common to stagger maize plantings to ensure a continuous harvest over the summer months.General care and maintenance Maize plants are heavy feeders, particularly of nitrogen (N) and care should be taken to provide them with adequate nutrients by applying fertilizer. Maize undergoes a rapid growth period between 30 and 40 days after planting and should be fertilized just before this. All fertilizer applications should be made before the tasseling period to ensure the plant maximizes nitrogen use. Be aware of symptoms of nutrient deficiency, plants should be a deep green color. Purple tinged leaves indicate that the plants are suffering from a lack of phosphorous, whereas light green leaves indicate a lack of nitrogen. Apply fertilizer. Plants also require adequate soil moisture throughout the growing period in order to tassel and form silks. Soaker hoses can be used to great effect in small to mid-size plantings. Pollination occurs when pollen is transferred from the male tassel to the female silk by the wind. Each silk produced a single kernel of corn and partially filled ears are usually a result of poor pollination.Harvesting Each maize stalk should produce 1 large ear of maize. Under ideal conditions, the stalk will produce a second, slightly smaller ear which reaches maturity slightly later than the first. Maize ears should be harvested at the “milk stage” of development, when the kernels within the husk are well packed and produce a milky substance when the kernel is punctured. Check ears for ripeness by gently peeling back a small portion of the husk. Be sure to check the ears frequently for ripeness and harvest as required as ears can quickly become over-ripe and lose their sweetness. Remove the ears from the stalk by pulling quickly downward while twisting and then refrigerate until consumption. ",

    "Growing grapes in the home garden is a labor of love. All the training and pruning and years and years of waiting for the first batch of grapes can be a lot to bear for any grower. When grape black rot ruins your harvest, you may want to throw in the towel. Fear not! There is black rot grape treatment, and, with some effort, you can defeat this merciless fungal disease. Black rot of grapes is a fungal disease that persists in grapevines for many years without treatment. The earliest signs of disease appear as yellow circular lesions on young leaves. As these lesions spread, they brown and sprout black fungal fruiting bodies that look similar to grains of pepper. With advancing disease, lesions may girdle the petiole of individual leaves, killing them. Eventually, the fungus spreads to the shoots, causing large black elliptical lesions. Although leaf symptoms are annoying, the real damage from grape black rot comes from fruit symptoms. In many cases, fruits are about halfway grown before they start to show signs of infection — the same small brown lesions on leaves will begin to appear on grapes. These areas soften, sink, and rot in just a few days and what remains of the fruit shrivels up into a tiny, hard raisin-like fruit, mummy covered in fungal fruiting bodies. Grape black rot is difficult to stop once it has taken hold of growing fruit. Many gardeners would consider this year’s crop a lost cause and work toward preventing a recurrence of the disease. The best time to treat black rot of grapes is between bud break until about four weeks after bloom; treating outside of this window is likely to end in frustration. However, if you want to try, captan and myclobutanil are the fungicides of choice. Prevention is key when dealing with grape black rot. During your fall clean-up, make sure that all mummies have been removed from the vine and all plant material on the ground below is destroyed. Prune out any and all areas with lesions; grapevines can handle a severe pruning — when in doubt, cut it out. If leaves appear the following spring with new lesions, remove these immediately and start a spray treatment program with one of the above-listed fungicides. ",

    "Esca, Botryosphaeria dieback, Eutypa dieback, and Phomopsis dieback make up a complex of trunk diseases caused by different wood-infecting fungi. The foliar symptom of Esca is an interveinal striping. The stripes, which start out as dark red in red cultivars and yellow in white cultivars, dry and become necrotic. Foliar symptoms may occur at any time during the growing season, but are most prevalent during July and August. They are often restricted to an individual shoot or to shoots originating from the same spur or cane. Symptomatic leaves can dry completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round, dark spots each bordered by a brown-purple ring, may occur. These fruit spots, which are better viewed on white cultivars, may appear at any time between fruit set and ripening. In severely affected vines, the berries often crack and dry or are subject to spoilage. Symptomatic fruit is found only on shoots with symptomatic leaves, but you can find shoots with symptomatic leaves and no symptomatic fruit. Cross-sectional cuts through canes, spurs, cordons, or trunks from which symptomatic shoots originate will reveal concentric rings of dark spots. Eventually the spur or cane from which symptomatic shoots originate may die. The appearance of foliar and especially fruit symptoms is inconsistent from year to year, which is thought to be due to possibly climate-induced variability in toxin production by the pathogen. A severe form of Esca known as apoplexy, which is more common in Europe, results in a sudden dieback of the entire shoot or adjacent shoots, rather than a gradual development of foliar symptoms. Every California vineyard is likely to eventually become infected with one or more trunk diseases. Preventative practices (delayed pruning, double pruning, and applications of pruning-wound protectants) are the most effective management approach for all trunk diseases. When adopted in young vineyards (i.e., under 5 years old) and used on an annual basis, these practices are likely to extend the profitable lifespan of a vineyard. Under California conditions, delaying pruning to as late as possible in the dormant season (February or later) has been shown to be very effective in reducing the risk of infection. Delayed pruning takes advantage of reduced susceptibility of pruning wounds to infection and avoids the period of highest spore release during typically frequent rain events in December and January. Double pruning is a modified version of delayed pruning for large acreages of cordon-trained, spur-pruned vines; pre-pruning is done in early winter (most often mechanically) by cutting canes to 12 to 18-inches above the final pruning cuts, followed by hand pruning to create spurs in February or later. Although preventative practices are most effective in young vineyards (before the vines become infected by trunk diseases), these practices have some utility in diseased mature vineyards. Wood cankers are very localized, thus protecting more pruning wounds means fewer new cankers each year resulting in fewer dead spurs, arms or canes over time. ",

    "On leaf surface we will see lesions which are irregularly shaped (2 to 25 mm in diameter). Initially lesions are dull red to brown in color turn black later. If disease is severe this lesions may coalesce. On berries we can see symptom similar to black rot but the entire clusters will collapse. It appears in the month of June and December. The disease attacks both leaves and fruits. Small yellowish spots first appear along the leaf margins, which gradually enlarge and turn into brownish patches with concentric rings. Severe infection leads to drying and defoliation of leaves. Symptoms in the form of dark brown-purplish patches appear on the infected berries, rachis and bunch stalk just below its attachment with the shoots. If the disease on the berries is not controlled in the field, it can lead to berry rotting during transit and storage. Bordeaux mixture (1.0%), Mancozeb (0.2%), Topsin-M (0.1%), Ziram (0.35%) or Captan (0.2%) is to be sprayed alternatively at weekly intervals from Jun-August and again from December until harvest to keep this disease under check. Two to three sprays of systemic fungicides should be given per season. Common in tropical and subtropical grapes. The disease appear late in the season. Cynthiana and Cabernet Sauvignon are susceptible to this pathogen. Fungicides sprayed for other diseases in the season may help to reduce this disease.    ",

    "The Common or European grapevine (Vitis vinifera) is a long stemmed, woody vine (liana) which produces high value berries, or grapes. The vines can reach lengths in excess of 30 m and can live for many years with proper management. The leaves of the grape vine are alternately arranged on the stem and are long and broad with 5–7 lobes, typically reaching sizes of 5–20 cm (2.0–7.9 in). Flowers are produced in clusters and fruit. The fruit is a berry known as a grape and grows in clusters from the vine. In wild species, the fruit is 6 mm (1/5 in) in diameter and ripens to dark purple to black with a pale wax bloom. In cultivated plants, the berry is usually much larger, up to 3 cm (1.2 in) long and can be green, red or purple. Vitis vinifera is native to the Mediterranean region, central Europe, and southwestern Asia but is cultivated on every continent except Antarctica. Most grape cultivation centers on the use of Vitis vinifera, however, in North America the related species Vitis labrusca, Vitis riparia and Vitis rotundifolia are also grown. Vitis amurensis is native to Asia and has been hybridized with Vitis vinifera to produce cold tolerant grapevine varieties. Grapes are the most widely produced commercial fruit crop in the world. They are often eaten fresh but are also commonly used to produce wine. Grapes can also be processed into jams, and preserves, juices, grape seed oil, grape seed extract, raisins and vinegar. Requirements The first consideration when attempting to cultivate grape is to select a variety based on the prevailing local climate, with the best production occurring in hot, dry regions. American varieties tend to be the most cold hardy while the European hybrids perform best in hotter, drier regions. Generally, vines should be grown in full sun, in a well draining soil and in a location where there is good circulating air to reduce incidence of disease. Low lying areas should be avoided when selecting a planting site as this can lead to water accumulation during periods of wet weathe Vines prefer a soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH between 6.0 and 7.0 and require a trellis system to support the weight of the fruit on the vines. Preparation Grape vines are usually planted as dormant bare root vines in Spring. Young plants can be purchased from nurseries and garden centres for planting in the home garden. Grape vines require a trellis and this should be built before the vines are planted in the ground. For information on constructing a suitable trellis see:  https: //www.plantvillage.com/posts/192-grape-how-to-build-a-trellis-for-grape-vines?locale=en. The trellis helps support the weight of the fruit and protects the vines from damage while aslo increasing air circulation and reducing diseases in the canopy. You may also consider a more decorative method of supporting the vines, such as an arbor. Planting New vines should be planted out in Spring after all danger of frost has passed. Dig a hole for each plant approximately 30 cm (12 in) deep and 30 cm (12 in) wide, spaced 1.8– 3.0 m (6–10 ft) apart and plant the vine at the same level as the nursery. It is important not to cover the graft union in soil. Tamp the soil around the plants and add any remaining soil. The newly planted vines should be cut back to have only 2 or 3 new buds and watered lightly. Training In order for grape vines to develop strong root systems and support heavy loads of fruit, new vines should not be allowed to produce fruit for the first 2–3 years after planting. The vine will produce new shoots, of which several should be allowed to grow while the others are cut back. This allows the vine to fill out with leaves which provide energy for an extensive root system. The new shoots should be attached to the trellis. At the beginning of the second year of growth, select 2–3 of the strongest canes on each plant and cut back the rest. Allow 3 or 4 shoots to develop on each cane and attach to the trellis. Remove any flower clusters that form. Pruning Pruning is an essential component of healthy grape production and should be carried out annually in early Spring while the vines are still dormant and before the buds begin to swell. From the third year onwards, most of the previous years growth should be removed. The more buds that are left on each shoot, the more fruit it will produce but care must be taken to ensure that too many are not left as the fruit may not ripen as a result. Fruit clusters can be removed as required throughout the growing season.",

    "Leaf symptoms of citrus greening include yellowing of one limb or one area of canopy, yellowing of leaf veins; blotchy mottling and/or green islands (spots) surrounded by completely yellow leaf tissue; twig and limbs begin to die back; fruits may drop prematurely and are often mishappen and lopsided; fruit has a bitter, salty taste  Huanglongbing (HLB) is a citrus disease that has profoundly changed the size and shape of worldwide citrus production, and the negative effects keep impacting the industry as the disease continues to spread throughout the various citrus growing regions of the world .Practically all commercial citrus species and cultivars are vulnerable to HLB. The disease has an array of symptoms which can be detected anywhere on the plant, from the roots to the leaves, changing the chemical characteristics, and sensory attributes of the fruit. In this review, the effects of HLB on orange juice quality are described based on the current scientific literature. Cultural control Once a tree becomes infected with HLB, it cannot be cured. Control is therefore reliant on preventing the disease occurring in the first place and this is achieved through strict quarantining to prevent the introduction of citrus psyllids to areas which are currently free of the pest. Areas which are subject to quarantine have restrictions placed on the movement of citrus plants, fruit, equipment and items made from citrus. Infected trees should be removed as quickly as possible from plantations and destroyed. Identification of infected trees should be achieved through several surveys to ensure that infected trees which are not yet showing symptoms are identified. In Florida, the recommendation is to scout groves at least 4 times a year for disease symptoms. Control of citrus psyllids Citrus psyllid populations can be controlled through the application of chemical sprays. Insecticides have proved very effective at controlling  where systemic insecticides are applied to the tree at the base of the trunk. In areas of the USA, Citrus health management areas (CHMAs) have been created to encourage neighbouring growers to work together to prevent the disease. Control strategies which have been implemented by the program include scouting, mapping and large-scale spraying to control citrus psyllids.  ",

    "This disease is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. pruni, and affects peach fruit and leaves. Infected leaves develop small reddish-purple spots that often have a white center. In advanced cases, the inner portion of the spot often falls out, giving the leaf a “ragged” or “shot-hole” appearance. Infected leaves turn yellow and drop from the tree. Lesions on fruits appear as small dark spots, which become larger and crater-like as the fruit grows. These lesions are generally shallow but can be ¼-inch deep. They do not develop the velvety spots of scab. Peeling the fruit will remove most traces of the disease. Water soaked, angular gray lesions on the underside of the leaves which turn purple and necrotic in the center and cause a shot hole appearance if lesion center drops out; if lesions are present in high numbers on leaves they may become chlorotic and drop from tree; cankers develop on twigs either as raised blisters or as a dark area surrounding a bud that fails to open; in years of severe infection the entire fruit crop may be lost; lesions on fruit begin as small brown, water-soaked lesions which may exude gum. Avoid planting susceptible peach varieties in areas where disease is known; once disease is visible it can be difficult to control, protective copper applications in the Fall prior to leaf drop and/or application in early growing season may help prevent the disease; care should be taken as peach trees are very sensitive to copper This disease is difficult to control, and chemical sprays are not practical for the home gardener. Varieties are available that are moderately resistant, but not immune. These varieties are ‘Ambergem’, ‘Belle of Georgia’, ‘Cardinal’, ‘Cherryred’, ‘Dixired’, ‘Candor,’ ‘Chalenger’, ‘Carolina Gold’, ‘Norman,’ ‘Loring,’ ‘Bisco’, ‘Southhaven’ and ‘Red Haven’ in a yellow peach, and ‘Southern Pearl’, ‘White County’ and ‘White River’ in a white peach. Bacterial spot is usually more severe on poorly nourished trees or where nematodes are a problem, so proper cultural care is important. Using good sanitation practices.

    "Peach, Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree or shrub in the family Rosaceae grown for its edible fruit of the same name. The peach tree is relatively short with slender and and supple branches. The leaves are alternately arranged, slender and pointed. The tree produces pink flowers which have five petals and emerge in January and February. The fruit is a velvety, soft, fleshy red to yellow-orange fruit which is oval in shape and 3-8 cm in diameter. Peach trees can grow up to 8 m (19 ft) in height and produce fruit for 10 to 20 years. Peach may also be referred to as nectarine, the two fruits belonging to the same species, although nectarines have smooth skin, and are believed to have originated in China. Peach trees are primarily grown for their fruit which is consumed fresh. Peach trees are also grown as ornamental plants. Basic requirements Peaches grow best in areas with warm summers and require a summer temperature between 20 and 30°C (68-86°F) for the fruit to mature. The trees also have a chilling requirement to break dormancy but fruit buds can be damaged by prolonged periods below -15°C (5°F) and as such, the majority of production takes place in countries which are relatively close to the equator. In addition, peach trees bloom early and can be damaged by late frosts. Trees grow best in well-draining sandy loams in areas that receive full sun but can will grow in a variety of soils as long as water does not sit on the surface after heavy rainfall. It can be beneficial to plant the trees on elevated land to allow cold air to drain away. Trees will grow optimally in soils with a pH of 6.5. Propagation Peach trees are propagated vegetatively to maintain the desirable genetic characteristic of the parent. Commercial trees are usually propagated by T-budding in the summer. T-budding involves joining a bud from a desired variety onto an appropriate rootstock. Buds can also be collected late in the summer for budding during dormancy. The budwood should be collected from healthy shoots of current season growth, leaves removed and the budwood kept moist until the union with the rootstock is made. The budwood is joined to the rootstock by inserting the bud stick into a T-shaped cut on the bark of the rootstock and allowing it to grow. The rest of the tree is pruned to force the growth of the new bud which has the desired characteristics. Planting Peach trees should be planted in full sun. Plant bare root trees in a pre-dug hole which is slightly wider than the root ball. Backfill the hole so that the tree is planted to its original planting depth ensuring that the bud union is above the soil line. It is usually possible to identify this from changes in the color of the bark. If planting multiple trees, space them at least 7.6 m (25 ft) apart. General care and maintenance Peaches should be pruned annually, including the year of planting and are best trained to an open center. When the tree is bearing fruit, it is important to thin the fruits to prevent the tree from over-bearing. Aim to have 1 fruit every 8 inches. This allows fruits to become larger and prevents the tree from reducing production the following year. Trees should be watered regularly during the growing season to aid with fruit development. During dry periods, water trees every 10 to 14 days. Apply water deeply and widely, to at least the width of the canopy. Trees will also benefit from the application of a nitrogen fertilizer in Spring.",

    "Water-soaked lesions that dry out and turn brown forming on the underside of the leaves; raised brown cankers on stems; cracked brown lesions on fruit. Bacterial leaf spot is caused by two major groups of bacteria, Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria and Xanthomonas vesicatoria (some literature will also mention Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria).  A number of races occur for each of these pathogens, with some occurring more commonly on pepper and others on tomato.  Both bacteria are gram-negative rods, have a single polar flagellum used for mobility, and are found only in association with plants or plant materials.  The BLS pathogens are seedborne, both within the seed and on the seed surface.  BLS may also survive on plant debris in the soil for 1-2 years, therefore a 2-year rotation out of pepper and tomato is essential. Disease emergence favored by warm, wet conditions; the pathogen can be enter a field on seed and transplants and can be spread within a field by wind-driven rain, clipping plants and aerosols.Use disease free planting material; remove and destroy all crop debris after harvest, or plow material deeply under soil. Seed can be treated with hot water (122°F for 25 minutes) or with Clorox® (EPA Reg. No. 5813-1; label available from Clorox at 800-446-4686).  Hot water is more effective for controlling bacteria on and within seed, but hot water can adversely affect germination if not properly performed (see ref. 3).  Treating the seed yourself nullifies the seed company's liability and voids their guarantees.  Mix 1 quart of Clorox® bleach (calcium hypochlorite) with 4 quarts of water to treat up to 1 pound of seed in a cheesecloth bag, add ½ tsp. of surfactant (dishwashing detergent), and submerge in the solution with agitation for 40 minutes, rinse under running tap water for 5 min, and dry seed thoroughly.  Treated seed should be dusted with Thiram 75W [dithiocarbamate] (1 tsp. per pound of seed), and planted soon after treatment. Some varieties currently have resistance to all three races of BLS (BLSR1, 2, 3) that commonly occur in our area.  These include Boynton Bell, Aristotle, Commandant, Enterprise, Revolution, X3R Camelot, and X3R Wizard.  King Arthur is resistant to race 2 and Admiral is resistant to races 1 and 2.  Resistance to races 1 and 3 are most important for the Northeast. Use of disease-free seed and a 2-year rotation in the field should solve most of the BLS problems, but some persistent cases may require chemical treatments.  Streptomycin (Agri-Mycin 17, Agri-Strep) sprays (1 lb per 100 gallons or 1 ¼ tsp per gallon) may be applied to transplants prior to transplanting.  In the field, applying fixed copper (1 lb active ingredient per acre) plus maneb (1 ½ lb 80WP per acre) has been shown to reduce the spread of BLS.   ",

    "Bell peppers, Capsicum annuum are a cultivar group of annual or perennial plants in the family Solanaceae grown for their edible fruits. Bell pepper plants are short bushes with woody stems that grow brightly colored fruits. The alternating leaves are elliptical, smooth edged, and come to a distinct point. The plant produces white or purple bell-shaped flowers which are 2.5 cm (1 in) in diameter. Red, yellow, purple, or brown fruit are produced each season about 3-6 weeks after flowering. Pepper plants can grow 1 m (3.3 ft) tall and are usually grown as annuals in temperate regions for only one growing season. Bell pepper may be referred to as red pepper, yellow pepper or green pepper and is believed to have originated in Central and South America. Bell peppers can be eaten fresh as a salad vegetable, or cooked in a variety of dishes. Basic requirements Bell peppers are warm-season crops and grow best at temperatures between 18 and 30°C (65–86°F). They can be grown in many soil types although sandy soils warm faster in Spring and are good for early planting. The soil should have a pH between 6 and 7. Peppers will not tolerate water saturated soil and should be planted in a well draining soil or raised bed. Peppers should be planted in an area that receives full sun for most of the day. Sowing seeds In most cases, pepper seeds should be started indoors 8–10 weeks before the last Spring frost. Pepper should only be direct seeded in areas with a long, warm growing season, otherwise seeds should be sown indoors in flats or cell trays using a sterile seedling mix. Plant seeds to a depth of 1.3 cm (1/2 in) and water lightly. Seeds should not be allowed to dry out as there will be a negative impact on germination rates.Trays should be positioned in a warm, bright, South facing window or under fluorescent lighting. The optimum soil temperature for germination is 21–29°C(70–85°F). A heat mat can be used to warm the flats if required. Seedlings will emerge within 8–25 days and after the seedlings has developed two sets of true leaves then they can be moved to a larger (3-4 in) pot. Seedlings should be provided with ample light and adequate fertilizer. Transplanting Peppers are usually transplanted 2–3 weeks after the last frost when the soil temperature has reached a minimum of 15.5°C (60°F). Covering soil with dark plastic or mulch a week prior to planting outdoors can help bring the soil temperature up more quickly in colder regions, allowing earlier planting. Beginning approximately 7–10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https: //www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The hardening off process is very important as peppers are very susceptible to transplant shock. The planting site should be prepared by incorporating plenty of organic matter to encourage vegetative growth. When transplanting seedlings, allow 30–45 cm (12–18 in) between plants and 60–76 cm (24–30 in) between rows. Side dress plants with a nitrogen fertilizer at planting. Drip or soaker irrigation is preferred to overhead irrigation and plants should be watered evenly to keep them moist. Mulching around the plants can also help to conserve soil moisture. General care and maintenance Peppers will benefit from applications of fertilizer to keep them supplied with essential nutrients. A timed release fertilizer can be applied at bloom or the plants can be fed with a liquid fertilizer at planting and every two weeks thereafter. In addition, pepper plants can produce a heavy load of fruit and it can be helpful to provide the plants with some support using stakes or cages to prevent branches from breaking under the weight. Use a soft material to tie plants to stakes or cages.    ",

    "Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a “bull’s eye” pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged. Early blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85˚F.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.For best control, apply copper-based fungicides early, two weeks before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when disease first appears, and repeat every 7-10 days for as long as needed. Containing copper and pyrethrins, Bonide® Garden Dust is a safe, one-step control for many insect attacks and fungal problems.

    "Potato, Solanum tuberosum, is an herbaceous perennial plant in the family Solanaceae which is grown for its edible tubers. The potato plant has a branched stem and alternately arranged leaves consisting of leaflets which are both of unequal size and shape. The leaflets can be oval to oblong in shape and the leaves can reach 10–30 cm (4–12 in) in length and 5–15 cm (2–6 in) wide. The potato plant produces white or blue flowers and yellow-green berries. The potato tubers grow underground and generally located in the top 25 cm (10 in) of the soil. The tubers can range in color from yellow to red or purple depending on the variety. Potato plants can reach in excess of 1 m (3.3 ft) in height and are grown as annual plants, surviving only one growing season. Potato may also be referred to as, spud, Irish potato, white potato or Spanish potato and originates from South America. Potato tubers are a staple food source in temperate regions and are eaten after cooking. They may be cut or sliced and made into potato chips or fries. Potatoes can also be processed into starch, alcohol or flour. Requirements Potatoes are cool season crops which grow best in cooler climates or as a winter crop in areas with warm summers. They are sensitive to heat but can tolerate a light frost. Potatoes require a deep, fertile, loose, well-draining soil with a pH between 5.8 and 6.5 and will grow optimally at daytime temperatures between 18 and 27°C (65–80°F) and night time temperatures between 12 and 18°C (55–65°F). Plants can also be successfully grown outdoors in burlap bags or large containers. Seed pieces Potatoes are usually grown from seed potatoes. Small sections of a large tuber known as “seed pieces” or small seed potatoes can be used. Seed potatoes can be purchased from garden centers when in season and through seed companies. Each piece of planting material should have at least two eyes. The eyes are the area from which a shoot will sprout and after cutting should be allowed to cure for a few days prior to planting in the soil. Curing helps to protect the seed pieces from rotting as well as reducing the likelihood of a pathogen invading. Curing is very simple and can be achieved by laying out the seed pieces on paper towels and allowing to dry out for 3 to 4 days. Planting Seed potatoes and pieces can be planted 0–2 weeks after the last frost or as soon as the soil is workable in early Spring bearing in mind that the plants will be killed by a frost. Prepare soil for planting by working in compost or well-rotted manure. Potatoes are commonly grown in hilled rows. This involves digging shallow trenches 60–90 cm (2–3 ft) apart after the addition of the compost or manure. Space the seed pieces 30 cm (12 in) apart and cover with 7.5 cm (3 in) of soil. When the plants reach approximately 25 cm (10 in) in height mound the soil up around the stems of the plants so that they are covered up to about half of their height. This protects shallow tubers from turning green from exposure to sunlight. Allow the plants to grow another 25 cm (10 in) and again mound the soil. Continue this process for the duration of the crops growth. Straw can be used around the plants instead of soil which eliminates the need to dig for the tubers but care must be taken to add fresh the straw regularly as it will break down over time. Alternatively, potatoes can be grown in containers or burlap bags. See:  https: //www.plantvillage.com/posts/712?locale=en General care Potatoes are sensitive to soil moisture and grow best when soil moisture is consistent. The plants generally require about 1 inch of water a week from rainfall or irrigation. Water-satureated soil should be avoided as it can poorly formed tubers and rot. In addition, potatoes are heavy feeders and the addition of a balnced fertilizer every two weeks can help increase tuber yields. Harvesting The time potato tubers take to reach maturity is variable and depends on the variety being grown, although it is usually about 2–3 weeks after the plants have bloomed. All tubers should be harvested when the vines have died or before a frost which will kill the plants. Harvest the tubers by gently digging them up with a fork or with your hands if the soil is loose enough. Harvesting is easier when the soil is dry. Do not wash the tubers prior to storing.   ",

    "Raspberry___healthy": ["/static/images/Raspberry_healthy_1.jpg",  "/static/images/Raspberry_healthy_2.jpg",   "/static/images/Raspberry_healthy_3.jpg",
    "Raspberry is the name given to two plant species in the genus Rubus, Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus occidentalis (black raspberry) grown for their edible fruit. Raspberry plants have perennial root systems and biennial stems which are known as canes. The canes are woody, erect and shrub-like and generally undergo a period of growth one year and fruit production the next although primocane varieties exist that produce fruit in the first year. The canes may possess spines. Raspberry plants produce white or pink flowers with five petals which are surrounded by green sepals. After the plant has been pollinated, an aggregate berry is produced which consists of numerous druplets which are held together into the familiar raspberry fruit by tiny hairs. Raspberry canes can grow from 0.5 to in excess of 2 m (1.6–6.6 ft) in height and red raspberry will produce a commercial yield of fruit for 16–20 years, while black raspberry has a shorter lifespan and will produce for 4–8 years. Red raspberry may also be referred to as European raspberry, red garden raspberry or hindberry, while black raspberry may be referred to as blackcap raspberry and may have originated in the Ide mountains of Turkey. Raspberries are primarily consumed as a fresh fruit or may be processed into jams, jellies, juices and pulp. Requirements Raspberry plants grow best in regions with cool summers and relatively mild winters. The plants are sensitive to high temperatures and grow best when daytime temperatures are around 25°C (77°F). Raspberries are best suited to well-draining sandy loams, rich in organic matter and have a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. Drainage it critical in raspberry propagation as the plants are susceptible to root rot. Plants require full sunlight and should not be planted in low lying areas where water may build up. Raspberries also require a post support system or trellis to support the weight of the fruit on the canes. Raspberry canes are biennial and produce fruit in the second year of growth. Canes in their first year of growth are called primocanes and those in the second year of growth are called fruiting canes or floricanes. The young canes are green in color, whereas the older floricanes are tougher and have a woody covering making them easy to tell apart. Preparation Soil may need prepared up to two years in advance of planting if major amendments are required. Acidic soil can be amended with lime to bring the pH up to a level suitable for raspberries. Organic content can be increased by planting a cover crop or by the addition of manure or compost. Avoid planting raspberries where peppers, eggplant, tomatoes or potatoes have been grown previously as these plants are host to Verticillium fungi which can cause root rot in raspberries. Choose a raspberry variety which is suited to your region. Red raspberries tend to be the most cold hardy, whereas black or yellow varieties are more sensitive. Planting and trellising Many raspberry varieties are very vigorous and using a support system such as a trellis will help to protect the canes from wind damage while also supporting the weight of the fruit crop. The trellis should be constructed before or at planting to avoid damaging the young plants after they are in the ground. The traditional method of supporting red raspberry canes is a post and wire system. This method involves running two wires about 60 cm (2 ft) apart vertically between wooden posts staked into the ground. The lower wire should be positioned 90 cm (3 ft) from the ground and the upper 1.5 m (5 ft) from the ground. The raspberry canes can then be tied to the wires. A second option is a T-trellis which is similar to the post and wire but the vertical wooden posts each have two cross bars to attach the wire. Two sets of wires run parallel to one another, one above the other. The vertical posts should be spaced 3.6–4.6 m (12-15 ft) apart with the lower wire positioned 90 cm (3 ft) from the ground and the upper 1.5 m (5 ft) from the ground. Raspberry plants in the home garden are usually grown from bare root plants or from tissue-cultured plants and should be planted in early Spring when the danger of any severe frosts has passed. The plants are usually planted in a row and the suckers will fill in the spaces to produce a hedge. Plant approximately 70 cm (27.5 in) apart, allowing 2.4–3 m (8–10 ft) between rows. Pruning Allow the raspberry plants to fill in the row to a width of about 30–38 cm (12–15 in) during the course of the growing season. Remove any suckers which are produced outwith this row. After harvest, cut the fruited canes of summer-fruiting varieties to ground level. Select 6–8 of the strongest young canes on each plant and tie them to the supporting wires so that they are spaced 8–10 cm (3–4 in) apart. Cut all of the canes of Autumn fruiting varieties to ground level after harvest. Cut back canes as needed in the summer if required to prevent crowding. ",

    "Soybean___healthy": ["/static/images/Soybean__healthy_1.jpg",  "/static/images/Soybean__healthy_2.jpg",   "/static/images/Soybean__healthy_3.jpg",
    "Soybean, Glycine max, is an herbaceous annual plant in the family Fabaceae grown for its edible seeds. The soybean plant is usually an erect bush with woody stems and alternately arranged leaves. The leaves possess three individual leaflets which are oval or lance-like in shape, growing to a length of 3–10 cm (1.2–4.0 in). The soybean plant produces small white or purple flowers and curved seed pods which are 3–15 cm (1.2–6 in) in length and can contain between 1 and 5 seeds. The seeds can be a variety of colors including yellow, green, brown, black or a mottled combination. Soybean is an annual plant, surviving only one growing season and can reach heights of 0.2–1.5 m (0.7–1.4 ft). Soybean may also be referred to as soyabean or soya and originates from Northeast China. Soybean seeds can be used to make flour and dairy substitutes such as milk, margarine and yogurt and meat substitutes such as veggie burgers. Oil can be extracted from both the seeds and pods and the by product of the extraction is used as an animal feed. The oil from the plant is used in products such as paint, linoleum and soap. Soybean is also grown as a cover crop and used as animal fodder or hay. Basic requirements Soybean is a short-day plant, requiring hot weather for optimum production. It can be grown year round in most parts of the tropics. Plants can be grown at ambient temperatures between 15 and 27°C (60–80°F) although temperature below 21°C (69.8°F) and above 32 (89.6°F) may reduce flowering. Temperatures exceeding 40°C (104°F) are detrimental to seed production. Soybeans are adapted to grow in a wide range of soils and climates but require adequate soil moisture for germination and seedling establishment. Plants are sensitive to waterlogging but are tolerant of drought conditions once established. Soybean grows best on a light, loose, well draining loam with a pH of 6.5. Propagation Soybean is propagated directly from seed. If seeds are to planted in a field where soybean has not been been grown in the 3–5 year previous, they should first be inoculated with nitrogen fixing bacteria. The seedbed should be prepared prior to planting by removing any crop residue, weeds and large stones. Tilling the soil helps to break up large clods of earth. Seeds may be sown mechanically or by hand. in tilled soils, seeds are usually planted at a depth 3.2–4.5 cm (1.25 to 1.75 in) in rows spaced 30 cm (11.8 in) apart. Alternatively, no-till planting may be used to plant seeds in the stubble of a previous crop without first cultivating the soil. With this method, seeds are drilled into the soil in rows spaced 17.8 cm (7 in) apart. No-till practices reduce soil erosion and reduces the loss of moisture in the soil. General care and maintenance Weeds are often a problem in soybean fields and can be reduced through good preparation of the seedbed and maintaining a weed-free seedbed for several weeks prior to planting. Weeds may be controlled with appropriate herbicides, where available, or through mechanical cultivation where necessary. Soybeans should be provided with irrigation at flowering and again at seed-set for maximum seed fill and optimal yield. Irrigation should be increased in sandy soils that do not retain as much moisture. Soybeans fix approximately half of the nitrogen they require for growth and the other half must be supplied from the soil or through fertilizer application. Soybean also requires an adequate supply of phosphorus and potassium and application rates should be based on the results of a soil test. Harvesting Soybeans are ready to harvest between 70 and 160 days after planting, depending on variety. Plants are ready for harvest when the leaves and stems have turned yellow and the seed pods brown to black. Soybeans for fresh use are cut while still green. Plants may be pulled by hand or cut with the use of a combine. Once cut, the seeds are removed from the pods by threshing. ",

    "Common on many plants and easily recognized, powdery mildew is a fungal disease found throughout the United States. It is caused by a variety of closely related fungal species, each with a limited host range. (The fungi attacking your roses are unlikely to spread to your lilacs). Low soil moisture combined with high humidity levels at the plant surface favors this disease. Symptoms usually appear later in the growing season on outdoor plants. Powdery mildew starts on young leaves as raised blister-like areas that cause leaves to curl, exposing the lower leaf surface. Infected leaves become covered with a white to gray powdery growth, usually on the upper surface; unopened flower buds may be white with mildew and may never open. Leaves of severely infected plants turn brown and drop. The disease prefers young, succulent growth; mature leaves are usually not affected. Fungal spores overwinter inside leaf buds and other plant debris. Wind, water and insects transmit the spores to other nearby plants. Zucchini, beans, cucumbers, squash, pumpkins, tomatoes, roses and zinnia are especially susceptible.  Plant resistant cultivars in sunny locations whenever possible.Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation. Make sure to disinfect your pruning tools (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.Remove diseased foliage from the plant and clean up fallen debris on the ground. Use a thick layer of mulch or organic compost to cover the soil after you have raked and cleaned it well. Mulch will prevent the disease spores from splashing back up onto the leaves.Milk sprays, made with 40% milk and 60% water, are an effective home remedy for use on a wide range of plants. For best results, spray plant leaves as a preventative measure every 10-14 days. Wash foliage occasionally to disrupt the daily spore-releasing cycle. Neem oil and PM Wash, used on a 7 day schedule, will prevent fungal attack on plants grown indoors.Water in the morning, so plants have a chance to dry during the day. Drip irrigation and soaker hoses will help keep the foliage dry.Use a slow-release, organic fertilizer on crops and avoid excess nitrogen. Soft, leafy, new growth is most susceptible.Destroy all plant debris after harvest (see Fall Garden Cleanup).   ",

    "Strawberry___Leaf_scorch": ["/static/images/Strawberry_Leaf_scorch_1.jpg",  "/static/images/Strawberry_Leaf_scorch_2.jpg",   "/static/images/Strawberry_Leaf_scorch_3.jpg",
    " Irregular dark purple or brown blotches on upper leaf surface which may colaesce to produce large purplish brown patches; tissue between blotches may turn purple or red; lesions may also develop on flowers and fruits; affected petals may wither and drop from plant; lesions may girdle peduncles causing death of fruit. Symptoms caused by this fungus (Diplocarpon earlianum) include numerous, small, irregular shaped purple spots on leaves. The spots, unlike leaf spot (M. fragariae), are purple throughout (no light centers) and have no well-defined border. Blotches may grow together until the entire leaflet appears purplish or reddish brown. Common leaf spot is caused by the fungus Mycospharella fragariae, which can enter a garden on infected strawberry plants or via windblown spores from nearby strawberries.  Once introduced into a garden, the fungus is spread predominantly by splashing water from rain or sprinklers used for watering.  M. fragariae is most active when temperatures range from 65°F to 75°F, with periods of high rainfall and humidity.  M. fragariae survives the winter on dead strawberry leaves and other plant parts, and is moved to new foliage in the spring by early season rains. Once common leaf spot develops on strawberry plants, the plants cannot be cured.  If the disease is detected early, its development may be slowed using fungicides.  Keep in mind however, that common leaf spot is often merely a cosmetic issue and the use of fungicides may not be warranted.  If you decide that fungicide treatments are needed, select a product that is labeled for use on strawberries and that contains captan, myclobutanil or copper as the active ingredient. Use copper-containing fungicides only prior to flowering.  If you decide to use a myclobutanil-containing product, alternate applications of this product with applications of a second fungicide containing another active ingredient.  This will help prevent selection of myclobutanil-resistant variants of the common leaf spot pathogen.  Be sure to read and follow all instructions on the label(s) of the fungicide(s) that you select to ensure that you use the product(s) in the safest and most effective manner possible. Plant resistant varieties; regular renewal of plants; plant in an area with good air circulation and drainage in full sun; remove all foliage from plants at harvest; application of appropriate foliar fungicide may be required to provide control.

    "Strawberry___healthy": ["/static/images/Strawberry__healthy_1.jpg",  "/static/images/Strawberry__healthy_2.jpg",   "/static/images/Strawberry__healthy_3.jpg",
    "Strawberry is the name given to several plant species in the genus Fragaria, including Fragaria vesca (wild strawberry), Fragaria grandiflora, Fragaria magna, Fragaria chiloensis and Fragaria ananassa (or Fragaria x ananassa) which are grown for their edible fruit. Strawberry is an herbaceous perennial in the family Rosaceae. The plant has a short stem and trifoliate leaves which form a crown. close to the ground. The leaves display a variety of characteristic depending on the species, some are evergreen whereas some have leaves that will die and fall off in winter. The plant produces flower stalks from the crown and the the flowers are white in color. The fruit of the plant is red and fleshy with small seeds on the outside. Strawberry can grow 20–25 cm (8–10 in) in height and has an economic life of 2–4 years before the plants are replaced. Strawberry may also be referred to as garden strawberry and the plant is grown in most northern temperate regions of the world. The first domestic hybrids were created in Europe. Strawberries are consumed as a fresh fruit or can be used to produce jams, jellies or preserves.Basic requirements Strawberries grow very well in cool temperate climates, at temperatures below 30°C (86°F)and require at least 8 hours of sunlight per day. They can be grown successfully in a wide variety of soils from sandy soils to silty clay but will grow best in a deep, well draining loam rich in organic matter. The optimum pH for their growth is between 5.5 and 6.5. If drainage is poor then it is recommended to plant strawberry on beds raised by a minimum of 15–20 cm (6–8 in). Strawberry varieties Strawberries generally fall into 3 categories:  June-bearing Evergreen Day-neutral June-bearing plants commonly produce large fruits, and, as their name suggests, will produce a crop of fruit over a 2–3 week period around June. Evergreen strawberry varieties produce two (and sometimes 3) crops of fruit per year in spring and late summer or early fall. Day-neutral strawberry varieties will give you fruit in the first year, generally produce smaller fruits but will produce whenever the temperature is between 1.6–29°C (35–85°F). Propagation Seeds It is generally considered to be more difficult to start strawberry plants from seed than it is to work with young plants. Depending on the variety of strawberry you have chosen, it may be necessary to cold treat your seeds before germination. This can be achieved by simply placing them in the freezer for 2–4 weeks before sowing. Strawberry seeds should be sown in trays containing a good quality, sterile seed starting mix. Sow the seeds to a depth of 6 mm (0.25 in) and keep the soil moist (but not wet) while the seeds germinate. Seeds should germinate in 2–3 weeks. When the seedlings reach 2.5–5.0 cm (1-2 in) in height, thin the seedlings if they are too close together and repot or transplant to the garden when they have 3 leaves. If planting outside be sure to harden the seedlings off before you put them in the ground. Runners Strawberries produce offspring on a sideshoot known as a “runner”. Runners can be removed from the mother plant and relocated. Simply plant the runners to the desired final spacing in a bed prepared similarly to planting seeds. Planting Begin preparing the strawberry bed as early as possible in the Spring when the soil becomes workable. Prepare the soil for planting by adding organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure. Plant the strawberry transplants 38–60 cm (15–24 in) apart depending on variety and allow 90–120 cm (36–48 in) between rows. Be careful to plant so that the crown of the plant (the point from which the leaves emerge) is at the soil surface. If planted too deep, the plants may rot and if planted too shallow the plants may not take root. After planting, water the plants thoroughly. General care and maintenance In the first growing season after planting, the plants should not be allowed to produce fruit in order for the plants to concentrate their energy of vegetative growth. Pinch off any flowers as they are produced. Fruit can be harvested in the year after planting. When the desired density of plants is reached cut off any runners or cultivate with a hoe. Weeds should also be removed from the strawberry bed regularly. Strawberry plants also require adequate moisture and should receive 2.5–3.8 cm (1–1.5 in) of water per week either from rainfall or irrigation if needed. Strawberries will benefit from the addition of mulch which helps to conserve soil moisture and protects the plants from late frosts in Spring. If frost is forecast after planting the plants should be protected with row covers or other suitable material. Plants can also be protected with sprinkler irrigation. Row covers can also be used to protect the fruit from birds when fruiting. Harvesting Fruit should be harvested regularly (every other day) when it is being produced by picking the berry along with the cap and 0.5 in of stem. remove the berries by pinching the stem. Harvest only fully ripe strawberries as they will not ripen further after harvest.   ",

    "Bacterial spot lesions starts out as small water-soaked spots; lesions become more numerous and coalesce to form necrotic areas on the leaves giving them a blighted appearance; of leaves drop from the plant severe defoliation can occur leaving the fruit susceptible to sunscald; mature spots have a greasy appearance and may appear transparent when held up to light; Bacterial spot  centers of lesions dry up and fall out of the leaf; blighted leaves often remain attached to the plant and give it a blighted appearance; fruit infections start as a slightly raised blister; lesions may have a faint halo which eventually disappears; lesions on fruit may have a raised margin and sunken center which gives the fruit a scabby appearance. Bacteria survive on crop debris; disease emergence favored by warm temperatures and wet weather; symptoms are very similar to other tomato diseases but only bacterial spot will cause a cut leaf to ooze bacterial exudate; the disease is spread by infected seed, wind-driven rain, diseased transplants, or infested soil; bacteria enter the plant through any natural openings on the leaves or any openings caused by injury to the leaves. Cultural practices and preventive sprays of copper help to manage bacterial spot.Bacterial spot occurs commonly in tomatoes throughout California. Using pathogen-free seed and disease-free transplants, when possible, is the best way to avoid bacterial spot on tomato. Use only certified seed and healthy transplants; remove all crop debris from planting area; do not use sprinkler irrigation, instead water from base of plant; rotate crops. Avoiding sprinkler irrigation and cull piles near greenhouse or field operations, and rotating with a nonhost crop also helps control the disease.Cultural controls and some copper formulations are acceptable for use on organically certified produce. Copper-containing bactericides provide partial disease control. Apply at first sign of disease and repeat at 10- to 14-day intervals when warm, moist conditions prevail. Copper is strictly a protectant and must be applied before an infection period occurs.Resistance to copper has been observed, but can be somewhat overcome by combining copper with mancozeb. ",

    "Common on tomato and potato plants, early blight is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani and occurs throughout the United States. Symptoms first appear on the lower, older leaves as small brown spots with concentric rings that form a “bull’s eye” pattern. As the disease matures, it spreads outward on the leaf surface causing it to turn yellow, wither and die. Eventually the stem, fruit and upper portion of the plant will become infected. Crops can be severely damaged. Early blight symptoms start as oval shaped lesions with a yellow chlorotic region across the lesion; concentric leaf lesions may be seen on infected leaves; leaf tissue between veins is destroyed; severe infections can cause leaves to completely collapse; as the disease progresses leaves become severely blighted leading to reduced yield; tomato stems may become infected with the fungus leading to Alternaria stem canker; initial symptoms of of stem canker are the development of dark brown regions on the stem; stem cankers may enlarge to girdle the whole stem resulting in the death of the whole plant; brown streaks can be found in the vascular tissue above and below the canker region; fruit symptoms include small black v-shaped lesions at the shoulders of the fruit (the disease is also known black shoulder); lesions may also appear on the fruit as dark flecks with concentric ring pattern; fruit lesions can seen in the field or may develop during fruit transit to the market; the lesions may have a velvety appearance caused by sporulation of the fungus. Early blight overwinters on infected plant tissue and is spread by splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of its name, early blight can occur any time throughout the growing season. High temperatures (80-85˚F.) and wet, humid conditions promote its rapid spread. In many cases, poorly nourished or stressed plants are attacked. Prune or stake plants to improve air circulation and reduce fungal problems.Make sure to disinfect your pruning shears (one part bleach to 4 parts water) after each cut.Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back up onto vegetation.Drip irrigation and soaker hoses can be used to help keep the foliage dry.

    "The older leaves exhibit pale greenish to yellow spots (without distinguishable margins) on upper surface. Whereas the lower portion of this spots exhibit green to brown velvety fungal growth. As the disease progress the spots may coalesce and appear brown. The infected leaves become wither and die but stay attached to the plant. The fungus also infects flowers and fruits. The affected flowers become black and drop off. The affected fruit intially shows smooth black irregular area on the stem end but later it becomes sunken, leathery and dry. The fungus Fulvia fulva causes leaf mold. It is first observed on older leaves near the soil where air movement is poor and humidity is high. The initial symptoms are pale green or yellowish spots on the upper leaf surface, which enlarge and turn a distinctive yellow. Under humid conditions the spots on the lower leaf surfaces become covered with a gray, velvety growth of the spores produced by the fungus. When infection is severe, the spots coalesce, and the foliage is killed. Occasionally, the fungus attacks stems, blossoms and fruits. Green and mature fruit can have a black, leathery rot on the stem end. Crop residue should be removed from the field. Staking and pruning to increase air circulation helps to control the disease. Avoid wetting leaves when watering. Rotate with vegetables other than tomatoes. Using a preventative fungicide program with chlorothalonil, mancozeb or copper fungicide, can control the disease. The fungus survives on crop residue and in the soil. Spores are spread by rain, wind or tools. Seeds can be contaminated. The fungus is dependent on high relative humidity and high temperature for disease development. Grow available resistant varieties. Avoid leaf wetting and overhead application of water. Follow proper spacing to provide good air circulation around the plants. Remove the infected plant debris and burn them. If the disease is severe scary suitable fungicide.",

    "Septoria leaf spot is caused by a fungus, Septoria lycopersici. It is one of the most destructive diseases of tomato foliage and is particularly severe in areas where wet, humid weather persists for extended periods. Appearing as tiny, round splotches on the leaves, this tomato disease (Septoria lycopersici) typically starts on the lowest leaves first. The spots have dark brown edges and lighter centers, and there are usually many spots on each leaf. Infected leaves eventually turn yellow and then brown, and fall off. Septoria leaf spot usually appears on the lower leaves after the first fruit sets. Spots are circular, about 1/16 to 1/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare. If caught early, the lower infected leaves can be removed and burned or destroyed. However, removing leaves above where fruit has formed will weaken the plant and expose fruit to sunscald. At the end of the season, collect all foliage from infected plants and dispose of or bury. Do not compost diseased plants. If the plants can still be handled without breaking them, stake or cage the plants to raise them off the ground and promote faster drying of the foliage. Mulching will reduce splashing soil, which may contain fungal spores associated with debris. Apply mulch after the soil has warmed. If the above measures do not control the disease, you may want to use fungicidal sprays. Fungicides will not cure infected leaves, but they will protect new leaves from becoming infected. Apply at 7 to 10 day intervals throughout the season. Apply chlorothalonil, maneb, macozeb, or a copper-based fungicide, such as Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide, copper sulfate, or copper oxychloride sulfate. Follow harvest restrictions listed on the pesticide label.  ",

    "Spider mites (Tetranychidae) are common pests of many outdoor crops including berries, ornamentals, vines, many fruit trees, hemp and cannabis. There are many subspecies of spider mites in the Tetranychus genus including the Pacific Spider Mite, Two-Spotted Spider Mite and Strawberry Spider Mite. Some species are more easily identified than others; however, it is generally unnecessary to do so as their biology, damage, and control measures are similar or the same. Spider mite populations can grow rapidly under the right conditions (warm with little wind is their favorite) and can be identified by the telltale webbing they produce on plant leaves. Unfortunately, by the time you see webbing, it may be difficult to control the population. Spider mites undergo five life stages – egg, larva, two nymph stages and the adult stage. Spider mites damage foliage by sucking juices from the leaves. This shows up as stippling on the leaves and more severe damage can result in leaf bronzing that may lead to leaf drop. Leaf drop increases incidence of sun/light burn and negatively affects both vegetative and flowering stages. Additional signs of spider mites are curled and/or burned leaf edges as well as leaves that have taken on a leathery texture. Webbing will be produced when mite populations grow in size and can be found on foliage, twigs and fruit/buds. Sanitize your growing environment thoroughly. This includes washing all surfaces of the growing area, selecting organic soil mediums and inspecting plants for mite presence before planting. Remove any webbing prior to moving forward.Optimize the growing conditions to the crop being grown and the environment being cultivated. Minimize mite damage by reducing water and nutrient stress as much as possible. Therm X-70 can be added to feeding schedules to increase nutrient/water absorption. Anything you can do to help your plants through hot spells will help control mite population growth. Existing spider mite populations should be treated with organic knockdown sprays if allowed. Naturally derived miticidal sprays like neem oil, pyrethrins, azadirachtin and horticultural oil can be sprayed directly onto adult mites, larvae, nymphs and eggs to kill on contact. Apply to active spider mite infestations at 3-day intervals until control is achieved. Horticultural oils can also be applied to overwintering sites to reduce egg populations. Exercise caution when applying oil-based sprays to plant in high temperatures (>80°) or intense lighting. Miticides should be used as a last resort in the flowering period of growth. Ideal for spider mite control during flowering. Introduce beneficial insects after knocking down spider mites for continued control. Match your growing conditions with the mite predator's optimal conditions and time releases in conjunction with other integrated pest management approaches. ",

    "The fungus infects all parts of plant. Infected leaves shows small, pinpoint, water soaked spots initially. As the disease progress the spots enlarge to become necrotic lesions with conspicuous concentric circles, dark margins and light brown centers. Whereas the fruits exhibit brown, slightly sunken flecks in the beginning but later the lesions become large pitted appearance. Target spot (fungus:  Corynespora cassiicola) can be a severe problem in both the field and greenhouse. Long periods of high moisture and moderate temperatures (68–82ºF) favor disease development. Pathogen sporulation is greater on the lower leaf surface than on the upper leaf surface. Symptoms may develop on leaves, petioles, stems, and fruit. Symptoms on leaflets begin as small, water-soaked lesions that expand and become light brown and circular .These lesions often develop a target-like appearance. Remove the plant debris and burn them. Avoid over application of nitrogen fertilizer. If the disease is severe spray suitable fungicides. Plant only certified seed and transplants; hot water treatment of seed to remove bacteria; rotate crops with non-host plants; turn crops into soil after harvest to promote decomposition Yellow halos develop around individual lesions .Lesions may coalesce and result in the collapse of leaflet tissue. Similar lesions develop on petioles and stems, but these are more elongate than those on leaves. These lesions may girdle petioles and stems and result in leaflet or leaf collapse. ",

    "The infected leaves become reduced in size, curl upward, appear crumpled and show yellowing of veins and leaf margins. The internodes become shorter and whole plant appear stunted and bushy. The whole plant stand erect with only upright growth. The flowers may not develop and drop off. The disease can be easily recognised when tomato plants are infected at the seedling stage. TYLCV causes severe stunting of young leaves and shoots, resulting in bushy growth of infected seedlings. Tomato plants infected early in the season are normally stunted and excessively branched. Such plants have terminal and axillary shoots erect while leaflets are reduced in size and abnormal in shape. Affected leaves are curled upwards or inwards. Flower drop is common, and therefore infected plants have a reduced number of flowers and fruit. If infection takes place at a later stage of growth, fruits already present develop normally. There are no noticeable symptoms on fruits derived from infected plants. Generally, table tomatoes are severely affected by the disease, especially when infection occurs before the flowering stage. Grow available resistant varieties. Transplant only disease and whiteflies free seedlings. Remove the infected plants and burn them. Keep the field free from weeds. Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and control whiteflies. If the insect infestation is severe spray suitable insecticides. Use only virus-and whitefly-free tomato and pepper transplants. Transplants should be treated with Capture (bifenthrin) or Venom (dinotefuran) for whitefly adults and Oberon for eggs and nymphs. Imidacloprid or thiamethoxam should be used in transplant houses at least seven days before shipping. Transplants should be produced in areas well away from tomato and pepper production fields. Sanitation is very important for preventing the migration of whitefly adults and the spread of TYLCV. Rogue tomato or pepper plants with early symptoms of TYLCV can be removed from fields by placing infected-looking plants in plastic bags immediately at the beginning season, especially during first three to four weeks. Maintain good weed control in the field and surrounding areas. Prevent the spread of any whiteflies to healthy plants. Tomato and pepper fields should be cleaned up immediately after harvest. Also destroy crop residues of melons and cotton immediately after harvest to reduce whitefly migration. ",

    "Symptoms can occur at any growth stage and any part of the plant can be affected; infected leaves generally exhibit a dark green mottling or mosaic; some strains of the virus can cause yellow mottling on the leaves; young leaves may be stunted or distorted; severely infected leaves may have raised green areas; fruit yields are reduced in infected plants; green fruit may have yellow blotches or necrotic spots; dark necrotic streaks may appear on the stems, petioles leaves and fruit. Mosaic diseases are the most common tomato troubles encounter edunder Illinois conditions. In fact, most tomato plantings have some degree of mosaic infection before the growing season is over. The seriousness of these diseases is not often recognized, however, for their symptoms are sometimes inconspicuous and the damage they do is usually ascribed to some other cause. At least three mosaic diseases of tomato are known to occur in Illinois:  common mosaic, aucuba mosaic, and cucumber mosaic. Common and aucuba mosaics are caused by two strains of the common tobacco-mosaic virus, which also attacks a large number of weeds and economic plants. Cucumber mosaic in tomato is due to a virus which also infects plants of the cucumber family as well as spinach, celery, pepper, and a wide variety of weeds and flowers. Plant varieties that are resistant to the virus; heat treating seeds at 70°C (158°F) for 4 days or at 82–85°C (179.6–185°F) for 24 hours will help to eliminate any virus particles on the surface of the seeds; soaking seed for 15 min in 100 g/l of tri-sodium phosphate solution (TSP) can also eliminate virus particles - seeds should be rinsed thoroughly and laid out to dry after this treatment. If the virus is confirmed in the field, infected plants should be removed and destroyed to limit further spread; plant tomato on a 2-year rotation, avoiding susceptible crops such as peppers, eggplant, cucurbits and tobacco; disinfect all equipment when moving from infected areas of the field. Mottled areas of light and dark green in the leaves are the most characteristic symptom of this disease. The dark green areas usually appear somewhat raised and puckered .The young leaves at the tips of the growing branches tend to be bunched and to unfold unevenly. Plants affected in the early stage of growth are usually stunted and have a yellowish cast.",

    "Tomato___healthy": ["/static/images/Tomato__healthy_1.jpg",  "/static/images/Tomato__healthy_2.jpg", "/static/images/Tomato__healthy_3.jpg", "Tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum (syn. Solanum lycopersicum and Lycopersicon lycopersicum) is an herbaceous annual in the family Solanaceae grown for its edible fruit. The plant can be erect with short stems or vine-like with long, spreading stems. The stems are covered in coarse hairs and the leaves are arranged spirally. The tomato plant produces yellow flowers, which can develop into a cyme of 3–12, and usually a round fruit (berry) which is fleshy, smoothed skinned and can be red, pink, purple, brown, orange or yellow in color. The tomato plant can grow 0.7–2 m (2.3–6.6 ft) in height and as an annual, is harvested after only one growing season. Tomato may also be referred to as love apple and originates from South America. Tomato fruit can be eaten raw or cooked and is used in many dishes. The fruit may also be processed into juice, soup, ketchup, puree, paste or powder. Requirements Tomatoes grow very well in warm areas at temperatures between 21 and 24°C (69.8–75.2°F). They require a deep, loamy, well-draining soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8. If soil drainage is a problem then tomatoes can be planted in a raised bed. Like all fruiting plants, tomatoes require full sun for most of the day. Tomato varieties Determinate (“bush”) tomatoes have been purposefully bred to grow vertically and remain relatively compact. The plant will stop growing once fruit begins developing on the terminal shoot and all the fruits ripen at around the same time. In contrast, indeterminate (“vining”) tomato varieties spread laterally and will continue to grow and produce fruit until frosts begin the the Fall. Indeterminate varieties can produce fruit all season and fruits will develop and ripen at different times. Heirloom tomatoes are generally open-pollinated varieties which have been conserved over many generations due to certain desirable characteristics such as flavor. Hybrid tomatoes are the product of cross-pollination between two parents with desirable characteristics such as high yield, early maturation, improved flavor or resistance to certain diseases. Sowing seeds In most cases, tomato seeds should be started indoors 6–8 weeks before last Spring frost. Seeds can be direct seeded in areas with a long growing season. Seeds should be sown in flats or cell trays using a sterile seedling mix. Plant seeds to a depth of 0.6 cm (1/4 in) and water lightly. If cells are being used, plant several seeds in each cell and thin to 1 seedling after germination. Position trays in a bright South facing window or under fluorescent lighting. The optimum soil temperature for germination is 21–32°C (70–90°F). A heat mat can be used to warm the flats if required. Seedlings should emerge within 6-14 days and after the seedlings has developed the first set of true leaves then they can be moved to a larger (3-4 in) pot and moved to a cooler temperature (16–21°C/60–70°F). Transplanting Tomato seedlings are ready to be transplanted once they are 15–25 cm (6–10 in) in height and have 3–5 true leaves assuming all danger of frost has passed. Beginning approximately 7-10 days before transplanting, plants should be set outside to harden off (see https: //www.plantvillage.com/posts/264). The transplanting site should be prepared by working in a balanced fertilizer according to the guidelines on the product label. Transplants should be spaced 76–123 cm (30–48 in) apart with a between row spacing of 123 cm (48 in). It is common practice to plant tomatoes in trenches on their side (see https: //www.plantvillage.com/posts/833-tomato) as tomato stems will sprout roots along their length when buried. Avoid over-fertilizing transplants, particularly with nitrogen, at this stage of growth as it will promote growth of foliage rather than fruits. Water plants lightly at base instead of overhead as wet foliage is more prone to diseases and the buried stem needs time to adapt and sprout roots. It is important that tomato plants receive even watering to prevent the development of blossom end rot, drip or soaker hoses work best and mulching around the plants helps to conserve soil moisture. Stakes, Cages and Trellises Staking, caging or trellising tomatoes supports the plants and helps to keep fruit off of the ground as well as increasing air circulation around the foliage which helps to prevent disease. The type of support system used depends on the type of tomatoes being grown. Determinate tomatoes have short or medium length vines and stop growing once fruit develops on the terminal branches. Determinates can be staked or caged but do not adapt to trellises. The position of the fruit means that little heavy pruning is required. In contrast, indeterminate tomatoes grow indefinitely and require a support system to prevent them trailing along the ground. The amount of pruning required depends on the support system being utilized - vines require only light pruning when caged, moderate pruning when staked and heavy pruning when using a trellis.  ",
